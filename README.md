# OptimalBreaks
Dynamic programming algorithm computing least costly order for breaking a string.

Given a string and a (strictly increasing) integer sequence indicating indices at which the string should be broken, this dynamic programming algorthm will compute the order of breaks which results in the least cost, assuming that the cost of any break is the length of the broken string/substring.
